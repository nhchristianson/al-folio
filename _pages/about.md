I am a first-year PhD student in Computing and Mathematical Sciences at [Caltech](http://www.cms.caltech.edu/); I am interested broadly in the structure, dynamics, and control of complex systems, and particularly those systems pertinent to problems in energy and sustainability.

Prior to my time at Caltech, I completed my undergraduate degree in Applied Mathematics at Harvard. While at Harvard, I worked on my senior thesis with [Prof. Boris Kozinsky](https://bkoz.seas.harvard.edu/group/PrincipalInvestigator) investigating the role of disorder in unlocking conductivity in solid-state electrolytes; prior to that, I worked with [Prof. Danielle Bassett](https://complexsystemsupenn.com/personal) at Penn on the structure of growing semantic networks of concepts in math texts. I spent some time my first year working with [Eric Peterson](https://chromotopy.org/) on computational methods for spectral sequence calculations. I am also passionate about STEM pedagogy: I spent six of my eight semesters at Harvard teaching or tutoring for courses in mathematics, statistics, and computer science.
