I am a first-year PhD student in Computing and Mathematical Sciences at [Caltech](http://www.cms.caltech.edu/), where I am advised by [Steven Low](http://netlab.caltech.edu/) and [Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/). In my research, I am broadly interested in designing algorithms for online optimization, control, and learning, with a particular emphasis toward applications in energy and sustainability.

Prior to my time at Caltech, I received my AB in applied math from Harvard. While at Harvard, I wrote a thesis on optimizing solid electrolyte conductivity with disorder supervised by [Boris Kozinsky](https://bkoz.seas.harvard.edu/group/PrincipalInvestigator); I also worked with [Danielle Bassett](https://complexsystemsupenn.com/personal)'s group at Penn on semantic network structure and growth in math texts.
